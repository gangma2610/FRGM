# A Functional Representation for Graph Matching
The implementation of our work FRGM ([[project page](http://captain.whu.edu.cn/FRGM/)] [[TPAMI](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8723156)]).

# Introduction
This work presents a functional representation for graph matching (FRGM). From the functional representation perspective, the matching between graphs can be reformulated as a linear functional between the function spaces of graphs for general graph matching. Moreover, the linear functional representation map can be viewed as a new parameterization for Euclidean graph matching, which allows us to estimate the geometric parameters and correspondence matrix simultaneously.

# Usage
The structure is organized as follows:
```
your_dir/
  -3rd_party
  -data
  -FRGM-D
  -FRGM-E
  -FRGM-G
  -GM_methods
  -PR_methods
```
The 3rd_party consists of some dependent codes (Shape Context, geodesic, linear assignment, etc) and can be downlowed [here](http://captain.whu.edu.cn/FRGM/code/3rd_party.zip). 
The data can be downloaded [here](http://captain.whu.edu.cn/FRGM/data/data.zip).

The [GM_methods](http://captain.whu.edu.cn/FRGM/code/GM_methods.zip) and [PR_methods](http://captain.whu.edu.cn/FRGM/code/PR_methods.zip) consists of the implementations of the compared methods on general graph matching and Euclidean graph matching with geometric deformations, respectively. And you can also download them from our new work [ZAC](https://github.com/wangfudong/ZAC_GM).
